What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I believe everything worked. At this point I am still slightly unsure if when I run main my code is being ran or the procedural resale shop. I would tell someone in the future that they do not need to create their own main and that main should run both procedural and object oriented programs. The homework seemed very ambiguous at first, I think it's important for students to know how important office hours can be to nnot just complete homework but to really understand what is happening.
